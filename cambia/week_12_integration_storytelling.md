### Week 12 — Integration & Storytelling

#### Goal: Convert knowledge into interviews.

This week is about **communication, judgment, and narrative**. At senior levels, interviews are less about reciting techniques and more about showing how you *think*, *decide*, and *learn*. Strong storytelling signals maturity, responsibility, and real-world experience.
